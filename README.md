# Subreddit-Analysis

I love Reddit. I open it almost every day, every night. I honestly open it to see memes most of the time, but other than memes, you can find many other subreddits that aligned with your interest or hobbies. One of the subreddit that I subscribed to is r/dataisbeautiful. It is a subreddit to share data visualitations and many of them are interesting. I never post anything on this sub though, I'm just a lurker. 

So, today I have a dataset that contains 173,611 unique posts that have been posted in r/dataisbeautiful. I got this data from this link (https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/dataisbeautiful). And I'm interested to find out what kind of insight this dataset could offer, if any. 

This is the question I want to anwer:
"Can we see a trending topic/subject from title from 2012 until 2020?".

Here's the result!

Please open https://muthbi.github.io/Subreddit-Analysis/ to see the rendered version. 

Thanks!
